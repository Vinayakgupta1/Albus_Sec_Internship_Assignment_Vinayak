# PYTHON_WEB_EXPLOIT_DEV_ASSIGNMENT

## Introduction
In this assignment, I explore the fundamentals of Python programming. This Assignment is designed to test the Python Programming Skills, including understanding of concepts and ability to write clean and efficient code.

## How To Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install any required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the script using `PYTHON_WEB_EXPLOIT_DEV_ASSIGNMENT.py`.
- Follow the instructions within the script to complete the tasks.

## Tasks and Approach
For each task, I followed a systematic approach to ensure thorough understanding and correct implementation:


- **Practical 1**: I started by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. Then, I used functions to encapsulate these parts for better readability and testing. 
The topics covered in the questions are:

   - **Conditional Statements**: Understanding and implementing `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditions in programming.
   - **Searching and Sorting**: Knowledge of binary search, selection sort, and merge sort algorithms.
   - **Mathematical Operations**: Creating a calculator for square and cube operations.
   -  **Programming Tasks**: Writing a Python function for matrix multiplication.


- **Practical 2**: I utilized Python's built-in libraries to handle data manipulation and analysis, ensuring that the code was efficient and concise. 
The topics covered in the questions are:

   - **Data Parsing**: Handling comma-separated values and extracting specific data.
   - **Networking**: Scripts related to networking tasks, such as extracting the default gateway address.
   - **HTTP Automation**: Automating HTTP requests to a web server.
   - **Password Security**: Generating strong passwords with requirements for length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

- **Practical 3**: For the final task, I implemented error handling to manage unexpected inputs and maintain the robustness of the program.
The topics covered in the questions are:

   - **Data Handling**: Questions related to reading and manipulating data from a CSV file.
   - **File Operations**: Basic data operations, possibly including handling missing values.
   - **Pattern Search**: Searching for specific patterns, such as email addresses, within data.
   - **Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like Dijkstra's to find the shortest path in a graph.
   - **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating a class to represent a bank account with methods for deposits and other transactions.
   - **File Management System**: Developing a file manager with functions like copy, move, and delete.


Throughout the assignment, I focused on writing code that was not only functional but also adhered to best practices in terms of style and documentation.
