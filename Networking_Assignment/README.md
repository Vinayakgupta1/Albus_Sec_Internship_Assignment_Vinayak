# Networking Assignment 

## Introduction
In this networking assignment, I explore fundamental concepts related to computer networks. This assignment contains various networking concepts and protocols essential for understanding computer networks' operations, architecture, devices, and troubleshooting.

## How To Use
- Ensure you have the necessary networking tools and software installed.
- Follow the instructions provided for each task.
- Use command-line interfaces or GUI tools as required for network configurations and analysis.

## Tasks and Approach
For each task, I followed a systematic approach to ensure thorough understanding and correct implementation:

- **Networking Assignment**: The questions covered in this assignment are:

  - **Computer Networking**: Understanding and configuring network devices and services, such as switches and routers.
  - **Network Simulation**: Using tools like Packet Tracer for simulating network environments.
  - **Cisco Devices**: Configuring and managing Cisco Catalyst 2960 series switches.
  - **Network Configurations**: Setting up VLANs and other network configurations.

- **Networking Practical**: The questions covered in the practical are:

  - **Network Troubleshooting**: Techniques and methods to diagnose and resolve network issues.
  - **Introduction to Networking**: Fundamental concepts and principles of networking.
  - **Ethernet Troubleshooting**: Identifying and fixing problems related to Ethernet connections.
  - **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Understanding and implementing STP to prevent network loops.


## ***üßë‚ÄçüíªComputer Networking Topicsüíª***

### 1. **Network Basics**

- Understand the basics of networking:
  - What is a network?
  - Types of networks (LAN, WAN, MAN, etc.).
  - Network topologies (star, bus, ring, mesh, etc.).

### 2. **Networking Devices**

- Explore common networking devices:
  - Routers: Responsible for forwarding data packets between networks.
  - Switches: Used to connect devices within a local network.
  - Hubs: Basic devices that connect multiple devices in a network.
  - Access Points (APs): Enable wireless connectivity.

### 3. **IP Addressing and Subnetting**

- Learn about IP addresses:
  - IPv4 vs. IPv6.
  - Subnetting: Dividing IP address ranges into smaller subnetworks.

### 4. **Network Protocols**

- Understand key protocols:
  - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
  - DNS (Domain Name System).
  - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
  - HTTP/HTTPS.

### 5. **Network Security**

- Basics of network security:
  - Firewalls.
  - VPN (Virtual Private Network).

### 6. **Troubleshooting and Cisco Packet Tracer**

- Use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate network scenarios:
  - Set up network topologies.
  - Configure devices (routers, switches, etc.).
  - Troubleshoot connectivity issues.
